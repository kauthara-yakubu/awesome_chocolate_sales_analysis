- **Shipments:** 529  
- **Region Drivers:** Canada, USA
  
✅ December recorded the highest profit, sales, and shipment volume of the entire year, with demand peaking in North America.

📌 Recommendation: Prioritize Q4 for seasonal campaigns, allocating up to ** 20 - 25% of annual stock and promotional spend**, with targeted focus on **Canada and USA**, which historically delivered the highest year-end demand.

✅ February had the lowest performance metrics across all KPIs, especially in APAC markets like India, which is consistent with typical startup ramp-up and post-holiday sales fatigue.
